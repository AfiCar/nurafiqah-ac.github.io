It’s not just a sport for me—it’s a way to challenge myself, build friendships, and express my passion for teamwork and strategy.

## My Family

Family is the cornerstone of my life. They’ve supported me in every step of my journey—whether it’s cheering me on at football matches or helping me achieve my academic and personal goals. 

- I have 2 siblings, and we love spending time together.
- My parents are my greatest inspiration, teaching me the values of hard work, perseverance, and kindness.
- Our favorite family activity? Going out for a nice meal as a family.
